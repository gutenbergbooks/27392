<div class="bk1"><p><i>The twins were a rare team
indeed. They wanted to build
a printing plant on a garbage
dump. When Muldoon asked them
why, their answer was entirely
logical:</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>"Because we live here."</i></p></div>

<h1><big>LEASE<br />
TO<br />
DOOMSDAY</big></h1>

<h2>By LEE ARCHER</h2>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">It was</span> the lack of sense in
the ad that made him go
back to it again. He was having
his breakfast coffee in the
cafeteria next to the midtown
hotel where he lived. The classified
section of the New York
<i>Times</i> was spread before him.</p>

<div class="bk2"><p>WANTED: Live wire Real Estate broker&mdash;No selling&mdash;30-40. Room 657 Silvers
Building&mdash;9-12 Monday morning.</p></div>

<p>The ad made no sense for
several reasons. One: you just
don't go around advertising
for brokers with four pages of
them in the classified phone
book. Two: how can one be a
live wire broker, without having
to sell? Kevin Muldoon
shook his head. Just no damn
sense. The Silvers Building&mdash;H'm!
Not too far off. He
looked at his strap watch. Fifteen
minutes of nine. He could
walk it in that time.</p>

<p>"Don't be a fool," he said
to himself. "It's obviously a
come-on of some kind."</p>

<p>He got up, paid the check
and went out. It wasn't till he
was on Third Ave. that he was
conscious he had started to go
crosstown when his office was
in the opposite direction. He
smiled wryly. Might as well
investigate, he thought. Can't
do any harm, and it won't
take long.</p>

<p>There were four others
waiting in the small anteroom.
The outer door bore no
legend other than the room
number, and the inner door
was blank altogether. Muldoon
made a quick appraisal
of those waiting. Three were
obviously past middle-age, the
fourth about Muldoon's age.
The inner door opened and
Muldoon looked up. A tall man
came out first, a man in his
early sixties, perhaps. Immediately
behind him came a
slightly shorter man, but very
heavy and with a head that
was bald as a billiard ball. The
older man marched straight to
the door, opened it and went
out without a second look
back. The fat man looked
around, his face beaming in a
wide smile, eyes almost closed
behind fleshy lids.</p>

<div class="figr">
<img src="images/001.png" width="326" height="500" alt="" title="" />
<b><small>The weird machine clicked and clattered while the twins
dreamed of tomorrow.</small></b></div>

<p>"And now, who's next?" he
asked.</p>

<p>The one who was about
Muldoon's age stepped forward.
The fat man motioned
for the other to precede him.
The door closed. Not more
than a minute went by, and
the door opened again and the
same act as before with the
older man was gone through.</p>

<p>"And now, who's next?" the
fat man asked.</p>

<p>Muldoon noted even the inflection
was the same.</p>

<p>So it went with the three
who were left, until it was
Muldoon's turn. And now
there were six others beside
himself also waiting to be interviewed.</p>

<p>It was a squarish room,
simply furnished, with a
couple of desks set side-by-side
with a narrow space between
them. A chair was set
up facing the desks, obviously
meant for the one to be interviewed.
Seated behind one of
the desks was the twin of the
man now coming to seat himself
at the other desk. Their
smiles were identical as they
waited for Muldoon to make
himself comfortable.</p>

<p>For a moment there was a
blank silence. Muldoon studied
them, and they, smiling
still, studied him. Muldoon
broke the silence.</p>

<p>"You know," Muldoon said,
"your ad didn't make sense to
me."</p>

<p>The twins hunched forward
slightly at their desks. Their
eyes brightened in anticipation.
"No-o?..." said the one
who had been waiting for
Muldoon. "Why?"</p>

<p>"With some four pages of
brokers in the classified directory,
you don't have to advertise
for one. And a live wire
broker gets that reputation as
a salesman. Without selling,
the wire is dead."</p>

<p>The twins beamed at each
other.</p>

<p>"Evin," said the one to the
left, "I think we've found our
man. Will you go out and tell
those waiting?"</p>

<p>They waited for the twin
to return.</p>

<p>"I am Robert Reeger, my
brother Evin," said the first
twin.</p>

<p>Muldoon introduced himself.
There was no handshaking.</p>

<hr />

<p>"You are right about the
ad," Robert Reeger said. "We
worded it that way for a reason.
We wanted a man of
quick intelligence. Mind you,
now, we do want a broker, and
one who will do no selling. The
'live wire' part was my brother
Evin's thought. He does
sometimes have clever ideas."</p>

<p>Robert stopped to beam at
his twin. "Just now," Robert
returned to Muldoon, "I won't
go into full discussion of our
plans. Briefly, however, we
are buyers, buyers, we hope,
of a particular area. Because
of what we have in mind to do
we would rather it was done
quietly and without any publicity.
Had we engaged the
services of a large agency this
would not be possible, for, if
I may coin a phrase, the trumpet
must blow strongly to announce
the coming of genius."
He smiled, stroked his chin,
looked up at the ceiling and
his lips moved silently as
if he enjoyed repeating the
phrase.</p>

<p>"I like that, Robert," Evin
said.</p>

<p>"Yes, I thought it was
good," Robert said.</p>

<p>They both looked to Muldoon.</p>

<p>Muldoon said nothing.</p>

<p>The twins sighed audibly,
in unison.</p>

<p>Robert's lips came forward
in a pout. The look of a pouting
cherub, Muldoon thought,
one trying to look stern, and
only succeeding in looking
naughty-childish. Muldoon
suddenly knew of whom the
twins reminded him. Twin
Charles Laughtons, without
hair.</p>

<p>"You <i>are</i> free to work for
us?" Robert asked.</p>

<p>"<i>With</i> you," Muldoon said.
"<i>I</i> have the license." He gave
them a quick smile, as if to
lessen the sharpness of the
tone he had used. "A broker
acts for a client in the purchase
or sale of property. He
can't be employed by them."</p>

<p>"Of course," Robert said
quickly. "I did not mean to
imply any other action. Now
suppose you tell us briefly
about yourself."</p>

<p>Muldoon gave them a
thumbnail sketch of his career.
He noted their pleased
look that he was a one-man
agency. At the conclusion,
Robert stood up and came
around the desk. He thrust a
hand at Muldoon.</p>

<p>Like shaking hands with a
piece of warm dough, Muldoon
thought.</p>

<p>"I do believe," Robert said
as he placed a heavy arm
around Muldoon's shoulder,
and walked him to the door,
"that we shall have a mutually
happy relationship. You will
not be unrewarded, moneywise."
He opened the door,
paused, still with his arm
around Muldoon, and looked
steadily into Muldoon's eyes.
"Yes, I think there will be
mutual benefits in our relationship.
Now, in conclusion,
will you pick us up at this office
tomorrow morning at
nine?"</p>

<p>Muldoon nodded.</p>

<p>"Good! Then 'bye now, Mr.
Muldoon, and thanks so much
for coming by in answer to
our ad."</p>

<p>The answer to an irritating
thought came to Muldoon
while he was waiting for an
elevator to take him to the
ground floor. He knew where
he had seen the same kind of
look as was in Robert Reeger's
eyes when they had parted.
In the eyes of a cat
Muldoon had once seen toying
with a mouse the cat had
caught....</p>

<p>Deena Savory was a redhead,
a green-eyed redhead
with a kind of patrician look
about her face that came off
very well in the photographs
they took of her. Deena was a
model, and made three times
the money Kevin Muldoon
made.</p>

<p>It had always been a sore
point between them, and more
than once the reason for their
worst quarrels.</p>

<p>She was also the worst cook
in New York.</p>

<p>Monday evenings were
spent in Deena's small apartment
on East Fifty-Sixth
Street, and she usually cooked
dinner for Muldoon. Invariably
it was steak. Deena had
no imagination when it came
to food. Even in restaurants
she ordered one or another
kind of steak.</p>

<p>They were together on the
couch, she stretched full-length,
her head in Muldoon's
lap. He was telling her about
the Reeger twins and what
had happened that morning.
His hands caressed her lightly
as she spoke, now across her
cheeks, now more intimately.</p>

<p>"... I don't dig them,
Honey," he said, as if in recapitulation.
"The Robert
twin, f'r instance. 'You will
not be unrewarded, moneywise.'
Madison Avenue and
Nineteenth Century English...."</p>

<p>She gently took his hand
from where he seemed to find
most comfort, and put it up
to her cheek. "What's the difference?"
she asked. "So long
as there's money in it?"</p>

<p>"Broker's commission," he
said. "No more or less."</p>

<p>"You've been getting so
much of that, lately?"</p>

<p>"N-no."</p>

<p>"Okay, then. Stop fighting
it. What do you care what
kind of English they use? Or
whether they used sign language.
The buck, kid, the
buck."</p>

<p>"Deena," Muldoon said
gravely, "you have the grubbing
soul of a pawnbroker. Or
real estate broker," he added.
He bent his head and
kissed her lips.</p>

<p>Her lips opened to his with
that familiar warmth, a hunger
for him which never failed
to thrill. This time she did not
remove his hand when it returned.</p>

<p>"... Kevie, baby&mdash;darling
... oh, my darling," she whispered.</p>

<p>Strange, he thought, that at
a moment like this, I should be
thinking of those fat twins....</p>

<hr />

<p>Muldoon hated the pirate
prices of midtown parking
lots, and so was late. It had
taken him ten minutes to find
parking space for the Plymouth.
As he started to open
the door of room 657 he heard
the voice of one of the twins.
The words or sounds were in
a language completely foreign
to him. He thought to knock,
but changed his mind. To
knock would have made it obvious
he had been listening.
He barged right in.</p>

<p>The twins were in the anteroom.
Muldoon got the impression
they knew he had
heard them, and an even
stronger impression, that the
fact was of no importance.
That bothered him, for some
reason.</p>

<p>"Ah, there you are," the
twin to the left said. "Evin
was wondering whether you
would show up, but I told him
he was putting himself to useless
aggravation."</p>

<p>That damned mixed-up
phrasing again, Muldoon
thought. "Took a little time to
find parking space," he said.</p>

<p>"Shall we be off, then?"
Robert asked.</p>

<p>"All right with me," Muldoon
replied. There was another
odd thing. Evin Reeger
seemed to have so very little
to say.</p>

<p>Their destination was a
place halfway down the Island.
Muldoon's brow had lifted
when they gave him the
area. So far as he knew there
hadn't been any development
in the area. It was just a bit
too far off the highways and
rail lines for housing developments,
and even more badly
located for industrial requirements.
He wondered what the
devil they had in mind out
there.</p>

<p>Traffic was light and the
drive took little more than an
hour and a half on the main
highway, and another fifteen
minutes of blacktop side road
before Evin told him to "Turn
left here," onto a rutted path
off the blacktop. The path led
through some scrub growth
that ended on the edge of an
acre or so of dump heap. Rusted
heaps of broken cars were
scattered about. A foul odor
came from the left as though
garbage, too, had been dumped
and left to rot. There was a
flat one-storied wooden shack
close by to which Evin directed
him to drive up to.</p>

<hr />

<p>Evin produced a key and
opened the door to the shack.
There was a partition separating
the place neatly into two
sections. There were a couple
of straight-backed wooden
chairs and a leather sofa in
the near room. The door to the
other room was closed.</p>

<p>"Sit down, Muldoon," Robert
Reeger said. He waited for
Muldoon to make himself comfortable
on the sofa, then continued:
"First time we've ever
been out here during the day.
But Evin's sense of direction
is unfailing." He shook his
head, smiled brightly. "Ah,
well, we must each have some
factor to make for validity of
existence, eh?"</p>

<p>"I don't follow," Muldoon
said.</p>

<p>"No matter. Now, to the
business at hand. I wanted you
to see the area involved. Evin,
the plot plan, please."</p>

<p>To Muldoon's surprise Evin
Reeger went into the next
room and returned after a
moment with a plot plan of
the lower third of the Island.
He gave it to Muldoon who
spread it at his feet.</p>

<p>"That red-pencilled area
I've marked off," Robert Reeger
said, "is what we'll be concerned
with. As you notice,
the dump and this shack are
at the approximate center.
What I have in mind to do is
buy all the land in the marked-off
area."</p>

<p>"<i>Buy</i> it!..."</p>

<p>"You seem surprised."</p>

<p>"Shocked, would be the better
word. Have you any idea
what this could cost? You've
marked off an area of approximately
a square mile.
Even out here that would run
into millions. And once news
got around that someone was
buying parcels of this size&mdash;well,
you'd have more publicity
than you might want."</p>

<p>"About the cost we won't
worry. There will be enough
money. But the attendant publicity
could mean not being
able to get the land we want.
Is that correct?"</p>

<p>"Could be. Suppose we get
options, or leases on these
pieces ..."</p>

<p>"That was a good phrase,"
Evin broke in unexpectedly.
"Don't you think so, Robert?"</p>

<p>"Yes!" Robert said sharply.
He seemed to have suddenly
lost his smile. He gave Evin a
hard look from under down-drawn
brows. He turned to
Muldoon. "We are renting
this, this tumbledown structure.
A two-year lease. H'mm!
I see your point. Spending
millions in a sudden buying
move would make unneeded
difficulties. No! Options to
buy, but lease for the present.
Evin, the list of names,
please."</p>

<p>Evin didn't have to go anywhere
for the list. He had it
with him. Muldoon looked it
over. There were thirty-three
names, including the County
and State.</p>

<p>"Well?" Robert said.</p>

<p>"I'll have to know what you
want to lease it for, the name
or names of corporations, and
so forth."</p>

<p>"Will my own name do?"</p>

<p>"It will. But you can go into
the County Court and register
a business name under your
own, what they call a D.B.A.
name&mdash;doing business as&mdash;name.
Register as many as
you wish. Doesn't cost a great
deal. Or form a corporation,
you and your brother."</p>

<p>"No. Let the leases come under
my own name. As for
what I intend doing, well, I
intend to concrete surface the
entire area."</p>

<p>"A square mile of concrete?..."</p>

<p>"Yes. There is a government
plan to use this end of
the Island for a huge missile
depot. They will have to come
to me."</p>

<hr />

<p>Pretty shrewd, Muldoon
thought. That is if it's true.
"All right," Muldoon said.
"When do you want me to
start?"</p>

<p>"Right now. That was one
reason for bringing you out
here. Evin, will you get the
brief case, please?"</p>

<p>Once more Evin Reeger
went into the other room. And
closed the door carefully behind
him when he came out.
He handed the brief case to
Muldoon.</p>

<p>"You may open it," Robert
said.</p>

<p>Muldoon's fingers became
suddenly nerveless, and he
dropped the brief case. It was
crammed with money, packets
of hundred-dollar bills.</p>

<p>"There are fifty packets of
hundred-dollar bills, totalling
a million dollars," Robert said.</p>

<p>"What the hell did you want
me to do, carry the case
around with me?" Muldoon
asked.</p>

<p>"No. It will remain here. I
merely wanted to show you I
will be able to stand behind
any price you may have to
meet. From now on report
here, no matter what time.
And, since time has a definite
value in this matter, do not
stand upon it."</p>

<p>"I like that," Evin said, suddenly.
"That was good, Robert."</p>

<p>Muldoon nodded. Evin had
a value, too. The same value
any yes-man has. But it bothered
Muldoon. This just
wasn't the way of twins. At
least none he knew. Well, one
thing was certain; the Reegers
had the ready cash....</p>

<p>"This may take some time,"
Muldoon said. "Weeks, certainly,
maybe months. The
County and State, alone ..."</p>

<hr />

<p>"We don't have that much
time," Robert broke in. "Evin
must return in ten days...."</p>

<p>"Return? Where?" Muldoon
asked.</p>

<p>It was as if Robert hadn't
heard. "The State and County
properties are small areas,
and on the very edge. Suppose
we forget about them for the
time being. Work on the private
parties."</p>

<p>"Anything you say. But it
may still take weeks."</p>

<p>"Then don't quibble. Lease
at any price. If a show of cash
is necessary, let me know.
Now I think you'd better
start. Good luck, Muldoon."</p>

<p>It was Wednesday night before
Muldoon saw Deena
Savory again. Nor had he seen
the Reeger twins since leaving
them Monday morning. Deena
and Muldoon seldom saw each
other during the middle of the
week; they were her busy
days and she needed the
nights for complete rest. But
he had called her and asked to
see her. They were at dinner
in a small Italian place close
to her apartment.</p>

<p>He had briefly brought her
up to date on what had happened
since she had seen him
last, and was at the moment
finishing the last of the lasagna
he had ordered.</p>

<p>"They're phonies, honey,
real phonies," he said. "I'll bet
my last buck on that."</p>

<p>She was looking at the last
piece of steak on her plate.
With an almost defiant gesture
she speared it and put it in
her mouth.</p>

<p>"Atta girl," he said.</p>

<p>"Mind your own business,"
she said. "How do you mean
they're phonies?"</p>

<p>"I spent all Monday investigating
<i>them</i>!"</p>

<p>"A fine way to make a dollar,"
she said. "What do you
care who they are?"</p>

<p>He gave her a knowing
smile. "That's my fat-headed
girl. Like to visit me in a nice
jail, wouldn't you? One with a
prestige address, of course.
Let me tell you. They rented
that shack, and the dump heap
next to it for a pretty fancy
figure. Robert Reeger said
they were going to do printing
in that shack. They paid in
full for the two years rental,
in nice crisp hundred-dollar
bills...."</p>

<p>"I get it! They were
phony," she exulted.</p>

<p>"How can you be so stupid?
I know. For you it's easy. Of
course the bills were genuine.
But the printing business&mdash;what
were they going to print
with, typewriters? Another
thing. There's no business record
I could find on them;
they're not listed. So how did
they get a million dollars, and
Robert said more. 'Report
here, no matter what the
time.' I don't get it. I drove
them out. There was no garage,
no car I could see, and the
place is miles from food. How
do they live out there?"</p>

<p>"Maybe they have friends
who pick them up," Deena
said.</p>

<p>"Maybe. Robert also said
there was a rumor or something
about the government
going to use the area for a
missile depot. I tried to run
it down. Nothing."</p>

<p>"Which proves nothing,"
she said.</p>

<p>"True. But I couldn't even
smell smoke. No, the whole
thing just smells bad. So I
think I'm going back there
and tell them to forget it."</p>

<p>"Oh, don't be an idiot," she
said. "This is your big chance
to make some real money, get
a reputation, and because
you're chicken, you're going
to throw it up."</p>

<p>"I won't get into anything
crooked!" his voice rose.</p>

<p>"The way you're thinking
you couldn't follow a straight
line."</p>

<p>"They can't draw a straight
line."</p>

<p>"Well, you do what you
want. Only, the next time I
have to pay for a dinner don't
give me that martyred look."</p>

<p>"Okay. Okay. What do you
want for dessert, spumoni?"</p>

<p>"After this, bicarbonate."</p>

<p>"Very funny."</p>

<p>And for the first time in
several years she did not kiss
him good night, when they
parted.</p>

<hr />

<p>He turned off the blacktop
and started down the rutted
path. He switched the headlights
off about halfway to the
shack, and parked it a hundred
or so yards away from it
and walked the rest. The
shack was dark.</p>

<p>Instead of knocking, Muldoon
walked around to the
back and peered through the
single window at the rear. He
could see nothing. Now isn't
this just dandy, he thought.
Drive all the way out here,
and nobody's at home. Damn!
He went around to the front
and started back to the car.
His attention was caught by a
greenish glow of light from
the far end of the dump heap.</p>

<p>His curiosity aroused, Muldoon
warily made his way
through the metal litter until
he was close enough to make
out the source of the light. It
came from the center of a
shallow area that had been
cleared of rubble. A rusted
misshapen mass of metal lay
in the center of the cleared
space. The greenish glow was
coming from an opening in
the mass.</p>

<p>Muldoon crept closer until
he was able to make out details.
Not too many but
enough to give him an idea of
the size and general shape of
the thing. But what really held
him were the figures of Robert
and Evin Reeger.</p>

<p>He saw them quite distinctly.</p>

<p>One of the twins was bent
over a machine of some sort.
There were levers, gears, and
rollers mounted on a webbed
platform no larger than a
rather oversized typewriter.
Muldoon's eyes went wide at
the sight of the greenbacks
coming in a steady stream
from the interior of the machine
and falling into a box at
the side. He could see very
little else that was in the
room, other than the brother
of the twin at the machine. He
was on the far side of it, fiddling
with something hidden.</p>

<p>Muldoon stared in fascination
for another minute, then
carefully made his way back
to the car. He had parked it
within the growth of scrub
trees and bushes. He started
it, turned the headlights on,
and drove slowly out into the
open and up to the shack. He
honked his horn loudly a
couple of times and got out of
the car and walked up to the
shack and tried the door. It
was closed.</p>

<p>Presently the figures of
Evin and Robert Reeger came
into view from the direction
of the dump heap. Muldoon's
figure was outlined in the
glow of the headlights. Muldoon
noticed the brief case one
of them was carrying.</p>

<p>"Ah, there, Muldoon," Muldoon
had recognized Robert's
voice.</p>

<p>"Hello, Mr. Reeger.
Thought I'd come by and let
you know how I've been doing."</p>

<p>Evin, who was carrying the
brief case, unlocked the door
and switched on the light. The
other two followed him into
the room. Robert Reeger motioned
for Muldoon to take
the sofa. Evin went into the
other room.</p>

<p>"Well, my boy," Robert said
heartily. "How is it going?"</p>

<p>"Slowly," Muldoon said casually.
"But the first of this
sort of operation has to go
that way. Kind of feel things
out, if you know what I
mean?"</p>

<p>"Of course. How does it
look?"</p>

<p>"I think it's going to go all
right. I've got plans."</p>

<p>"Splendid! Do you need
money?"</p>

<p>"Yes. About ten thousand."</p>

<p>"Evin! Do bring the case
out," Robert called loudly.</p>

<p>In a couple of seconds, Evin
Reeger appeared. He brought
the brief case to his brother,
turned, and went back into
the other room without saying
anything. He walked slowly
and stiffly, his feet slapping
heavily on the bare boards.</p>

<p>"What's wrong with him?"
Muldoon asked.</p>

<p>Robert Reeger was pulling
money from the brief case. He
looked up with an expressionless
face. "Nothing. You said
ten thousand?..."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Reeger passed two of the
packets to Muldoon. "Sure
you won't need more?"</p>

<p>Muldoon put the money
away, got up from the sofa,
and started to the door. "No.
Just what I need. Uh, I'll see
you Friday night."</p>

<p>"Fine! And don't forget.
We must get all this done
quickly."</p>

<p>"I won't forget."</p>

<hr />

<p>Robert Reeger waited till
the sound of the Plymouth
was no longer heard. Then he
went into the other room.
Other than for two army cots
the room was empty. Evin
was stretched full-length on
one of the cots.</p>

<p>"You're certain he knows?"
Evin asked.</p>

<p>"Yes. I saw him on the
visio."</p>

<p>"But he couldn't see all the
interior?"</p>

<p>"No. Just the duplicating
machine. We must get rid of it
tonight."</p>

<p>"What do you think he will
do?"</p>

<p>"What can he do? He knows
nothing. The money is genuine,
and with the destruction
of the machine he can't prove
anything. Nevertheless it
might be the wisest course to
get rid of him. We might have
been too clever with that advertisement."</p>

<p>"Possibly. But, we must
move quickly, then. I must
leave this planet in seven days
now. And we must have this
area under lease by then.
Three musts!"</p>

<p>Robert smiled thinly. "We
will. If not through Muldoon,
then through another means.
When you return in a year
with the space fleet you will
find the landing area we
need."</p>

<p>"And after that ..."</p>

<p>They smiled at each other.</p>

<p>"We said we would not fail.
This planet will fall to our
weapons like ripe fruit from
a tree."</p>

<p>"But first I must return to
tell them," Evin said. "If I do
not return they will know we
have failed, and will seek another
planet."</p>

<p>"We won't fail," Robert reiterated.
"Right now, let's get
back to the space ship and the
duplicating machine."</p>

<hr />

<p>Muldoon spent a busy
Thursday. A newsbrief in the
<i>Times</i> financial section which
told of a public utility wanting
Island property gave him an
idea for one thing. He spent
all morning bringing the idea
to a head, after he had verified
the truth of the item. Then,
after a late lunch, he went to
the Treasury Department's
headquarters and spent a
couple of hours with the head
of the local investigation department.</p>

<p>He was quite pleased with
himself by nightfall, as he
headed out to the Island. This
time he parked the car at a
considerable distance from
the shack. There were lights
on, this night. He walked boldly
up and knocked at the door.
It opened wide and the thick
figure of one of the twins
darkened the opening.</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Muldoon. I did
not think to see you till Friday."</p>

<p>"I thought I'd come and see
you tonight," Muldoon said as
he stepped into the room.</p>

<p>"I didn't hear the car."</p>

<p>"Oh. Parked it back a bit,"
Muldoon said. He turned toward
the other twin as the
inner door opened. "Hello."</p>

<p>"Hello."</p>

<p>"You know, Evin," Robert
said, "I'm rather glad Muldoon
stopped by tonight. We
might as well conclude our
business with him now."</p>

<p>"An excellent idea, Robert.
Excellent."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" Muldoon
asked. "I no longer am
acting for you?"</p>

<p>"Not for us, for yourself.
I'm afraid your services, in
any capacity, will no longer be
needed."</p>

<p>Muldoon caught the undercurrent
of menace in Robert's
voice. It told him they were
not only suspicious but ready
to act on it. He started to
edge toward the door, but
Robert suddenly reached out
and took his arm. There was
power in the fat man's grip.
Evin moved swiftly for his
size, and took up a position
before the door, which he
kicked shut.</p>

<p>Muldoon twisted sharply
and was free of the other's
grip. He stepped back a couple
of paces. "What the hell's this
all about?"</p>

<p>"Come now, Muldoon,"
Robert said softly. "You
didn't think your prying went
unobserved, last night?"</p>

<p>"So I was nosey. But what's
this rough stuff you're trying
to pull?"</p>

<p>"Merely making sure your
curiosity will end tonight."</p>

<hr />

<p>Muldoon took a couple of
more retreating paces. "You
mean you're going to get rid
of me? Well, maybe you will,
and maybe you won't. But
even if you do ..."</p>

<p>A smile broke through the
grim lips of the twin threatening
Muldoon. "You mean the
duplicating machine? Just another
piece of rusted scrap
among the rest of the junk."</p>

<p>Muldoon paled. The evidence
he was going to need,
gone.</p>

<p>"And of course the money
is genuine. We made sure of
it. Ink, paper, everything. We
made sure of it long ago. It
will be a pity you won't be
here to see how efficient we
can really be. But the rest of
the planet will know. As soon
as Evin returns."</p>

<p>Muldoon's mind was working
swiftly. "You got rid of
the machine. But what about
the junk shop it was in. I'll
bet there are more important
things there."</p>

<p>"Indeed there are. But no
one will find it. It will be just
another rusted piece of large
junk to them."</p>

<p>It was then Muldoon made
his move. He lashed out with
a fist. The blow staggered
Robert. And Muldoon was
crashing his shoulder against
the inner door. It burst inward,
but before he could get
through Robert grabbed him.
The whole side of Muldoon's
face went numb as Robert
crashed his fist against his
jaw. Muldoon knew he didn't
stand a chance in a straight-up
fight, not with these two.
Robert's hands were reaching
for him, now.</p>

<p>Muldoon grabbed one of the
hands with both of his, twisted
outward as he grasped two
fingers in each hand. Robert's
face went putty-grey as the
bones snapped. Muldoon no
longer cared about fair play.
His knee came up where it
could do most damage, and
Robert sank grovelling to the
floor.</p>

<p>Muldoon whirled. Too late.
The world exploded in a
thousand flashes of pain-filled
lights. He went crashing backward
into the wall. Evin hit
him again before he stumbled
blindly away from the terrible
fist.</p>

<p>"Let me kill him," Robert
groaned.</p>

<p>Muldoon pulled himself up
from the pain-filled world he
had been sent into. There
seemed to be two Evins facing
him. Then there was only one.
A twisted grin came to Muldoon's
lips. "Come ahead, you
rat," he mumbled.</p>

<p>Evin came forward. And
swift as an adder Muldoon
kicked him just below the
knee cap. Evin screamed, and
collapsed. Muldoon staggered
out of the way of the falling
body, only to fall into the
clutches of Robert's sudden
reaching fingers.</p>

<p>He fell to the floor.</p>

<p>Robert tried to get his good
hand up to Muldoon's throat.
Muldoon beat at the thick
face with both hands. But the
other seemed not to feel the
pounding fists. Slowly the fingers
managed to reach their
goal. Muldoon felt the darkness
of death closing over him
as his breath became a tortured
dying gasp. His hand
found Robert's face, came
gently over it until his thumb
pressed on one eyeball. And
Robert screamed as the thumb
became a hooked instrument
to blind him.</p>

<p>Muldoon rolled away from
the other, staggered somehow
erect, but knew his strength
was gone. He couldn't make it
to the door. And now Evin had
him....</p>

<p>And the door burst open
and men poured into the room.
Muldoon recognized only one,
the head of the Treasury's investigation
department, before
he blacked out.</p>

<hr />

<p>Deena Savory stroked his
forehead gently. "Does it hurt
much, baby?"</p>

<p>The nurse had left them
alone when Deena came into
the hospital room.</p>

<p>"Not now," Muldoon said.</p>

<p>"What are they going to do
to those men?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, twenty years, according
to Phillips. Counterfeiting,
you know, carries heavy
penalties."</p>

<p>"But I thought the money
was good? After all, they had
paid rent with C-notes."</p>

<p>"A slip-up on the bank's
part. You see they made one
mistake. The machine they
had, turned out perfect bills.
Every one with the same serial
number...."</p>

<p>Deena's eyes widened.</p>

<p>"And the junk shop or
whatever it was?" she said.</p>

<p>"I thought I'd let well
enough alone. You see I took
care of that during the day.
The twins, being criminals,
had automatically broken
their lease. They also made it
possible for me to change clients.
Well, there's going to be
a huge tank covering that
dump and shack, a tank holding
an awful lot of natural
gas. I got together with the
owner of the property and the
utility people yesterday afternoon
and worked out a deal.
They're going to dump all
that junk into the ocean."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry about the other
night," she said suddenly.</p>

<p>"Is that how you say you're
sorry?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Uh-uh," she said, as he
reached for her. "There's a
time and place for that."</p>

<p>"Promise."</p>

<p class="hd1">Her lips agreed.</p>
